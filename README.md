## üíæ How to Install

Follow these steps to install sshmx:

1. **Download** the appropriate file from the releases page.
2. Extract the downloaded file if it is in a compressed format (zip, tar, etc.).
3. Move the extracted file to a directory in your system PATH. This allows you to run sshmx from any terminal.

   - For example, on Linux or macOS, you can use:
     ```
     mv sshmx /usr/local/bin/
     ```

   - On Windows, you might consider placing it in:
     ```
     C:\Program Files\sshmx\
     ```

4. **Set Permissions** if you are using Linux or macOS:
   ```
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sshmx
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Using sshmx

### Basic Commands

Here are some basic commands to get you started:

1. **Add SSH Host:**
   To add a new SSH host, use:
   ```
   sshmx add [alias] [hostname]
   ```

   Example:
   ```
   sshmx add myserver 192.168.1.1
   ```

2. **List SSH Hosts:**
   To see all your saved SSH hosts, run:
   ```
   sshmx list
   ```

3. **Connect to an SSH Host:**
   To connect to a saved SSH host, use:
   ```
   sshmx connect [alias]
   ```

   Example:
   ```
   sshmx connect myserver
   ```

### Saving Configurations

You can save configurations for each host:

- Specify a port:
  ```
  sshmx add [alias] [hostname] --port [port_number]
  ```

- Set a custom user:
  ```
  sshmx add [alias] [hostname] --user [username]
  ```

### Removing Hosts

To remove a saved SSH host, use:
```
sshmx remove [alias]
```

Example:
```
sshmx remove myserver
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Command Not Found:** If you see a "command not found" error, ensure that the sshmx file is in your system PATH.
- **Permission Denied:** If you cannot run sshmx, check if you followed the step to set permissions correctly on Linux or macOS.
- **Connection Issues:** Verify that your network is working and that the hostname and port are correct.
