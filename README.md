# sshmx - SSH Session Manager for tmux

`sshmx` is a lightweight Bash utility that helps you manage and launch SSH sessions inside [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).  
It integrates with your existing `~/.ssh/config` or lets you add/remove sessions interactively, and provides a handy **tmux key binding** (`Ctrl+b C-s`) to quickly open SSH connections in popup windows.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Interactive SSH session selector** using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).
- **Automatic JSON session store** (`~/.ssh/sessions.json`).
- **Import from `~/.ssh/config`** or create sessions manually.
- **tmux integration**:
  - New SSH sessions open in dedicated `tmux` windows.
  - Popup window shortcut (`Ctrl+b C-s`) to run `sshmx`.
- **Jump host (ProxyJump) support**.
- **Password and private key support** (passwords require `sshpass`).
- **Optional colored output** with [chromaterm](https://github.com/hSaria/Chromaterm).
- **Self-installing** script ‚Äì just run once and it sets itself up.

## üì¶ Requirements
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)
- [sshpass](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sshpass) *(optional, for password auth)*
- [chromaterm](https://github.com/hSaria/Chromaterm) *(optional, for colored output)*

## üöÄ Installation
Clone the repository and run the script with the `--install` flag:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sshmx.git
cd sshmx
./sshmx.sh --install
````

This will:

* Create a symlink to `~/.local/bin/sshmx`.
* Add `Ctrl+b C-s` binding to your `~/.tmux.conf` (or create one if missing).
* Add bash completion for command flags.
* Add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH (via `~/.bashrc`).

Reload tmux:

```bash
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

---

## üîë Usage

### First run

The script auto-generates a `sessions.json` file at `~/.ssh/sessions.json` by parsing your `~/.ssh/config`.
If no sessions are found, it creates a sample entry.

### Launch SSH sessions

```bash
sshmx
```

* Prompts you with an `fzf` selector of available sessions.
* Selected hosts open as **new windows** in your tmux session.
* If run outside tmux, a new session named `sshmx` is created.

### Add a new session

```bash
sshmx --add
```

or

```bash
sshmx -a
```

Prompts for hostname, user, port, key, etc., and appends to `sessions.json`.

### Remove sessions

```bash
sshmx --remove
```

or

```bash
sshmx -r
```

Lets you multi-select sessions to delete using `fzf`.
A backup of `sessions.json` is automatically created.

### Reinstall / update config

```bash
sshmx --install
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Example Workflow

1. Press `Ctrl+b C-s` inside tmux.
2. `fzf` shows your saved sessions.
3. Select one or more hosts.
4. New tmux windows open, each running SSH into the chosen host(s).

---

## üìÇ Files

* `~/.ssh/sessions.json` ‚Üí Stores your SSH sessions.
* `~/.ssh-session-manager.log` ‚Üí Log file with parsing/debug info.
* `~/.tmux.conf` ‚Üí Key binding automatically added here.
* `~/.local/bin/sshmx` ‚Üí Symlink to the script for global usage.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes

* Passwords are stored in plain text if you choose to use them.
  It‚Äôs **highly recommended** to use SSH keys instead.
* Temporary configs for jump hosts are auto-cleaned after use.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap / Ideas

* [ ] Encrypted session store.
* [ ] Auto-sync with `~/.ssh/config`.
* [ ] Advanced UI with [fzf preview](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#preview-window).
